# Knowledge-based Execution Configuration for Adaptive Behavior Trees



## Description

This repository contains the knowledge files supporting the implementation and evaluation of the methods presented in the paper "Knowledge-based Execution Configuration for Adaptive Behavior Trees.", part of the BeAware framework.

The included resources provide essential components to understand and extend the example scenario discussed in the paper, including:

- Behavior Trees (BTs): Templates defining the structure and flow for the example scenario’s adaptive behaviors.

- Ontologies:
    - `beaware_ontology.owl`: The base ontology to use in the BeAware Framework.

    - `application_ontology_example.owl`: An instantiated ontology tailored for the specific example scenario.

- PDDL: A Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) domain file that formalizes the planning aspects of the example scenario.
